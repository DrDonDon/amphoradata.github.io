> Amphora Data is currently in beta. These documents may change.

You can request data in multiple ways.

Firstly, you can send a blast to the community through our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/amphoradata/community). As with all channel blasts, you may receive lots of responses or not many.

Secondly, you message the Amphora Data team at contact@amphoradata.com. They will review all options and help provide the best solution for you.

Thirdly, if you want a slighly modified Amphora to what is listed, reach out to the creator of the Amphora and they may be able to help you.
