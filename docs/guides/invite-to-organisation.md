If you want to share data or collaborate with colleagues, you can easily invite them to your organisation. 

From your Organisation's detail page, find the `Invite` button in the `Members` section.

You will get a screen similar to below. Enter an email address, and it will be invited to join *your* organisation. Only Organisational administators with confirmed email addresses have permission to invite others.

> Warning! Only invite emails that you trust.
