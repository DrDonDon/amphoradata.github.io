> Amphora Data is currently in beta. These documents may change.

## Create an Amphora Data account.

Head to [amphoradata.com](https://beta.amphoradata.com) and register with your organisational email address. You can either request access from the website or use an invite from email.

### Create a new Organisation

If you're the first member of your organisation to sign up, then you'll need to create an [Amphora Data Organisation](../models/organisation.md).

### Join an existing Organisation

If your organisation is already represented in Amphora Data, then you'll need to be [invited](guides/invite-to-organisation.md) into the Organisation. To join an organisation, once you've been invited, click `Find my Organisation`, and search for the name of the Organisation.

By clicking `Join Organisation` you can request to join that organisation. If you've already been invited to an organisation, you should be automatically redirected to join that org.
