## Create your first Amphora

Navigate to the `Amphorae` page, and click on the `Create` button.

> At this stage, you can describe the Amphora, but *not yet* add any data. That comes later.

Give your Amphora a Name, Description, Price, and Geo-Location. You can search for locations, or just enter the Lat/Lon manually. These need to be entered into the fields below.

As Amphoras have standardised metadata, please ensure all fields are correct so others can find and use your Amphora.

### Add a file

> The max file size is currently 10MB. If you need more, let us know.

You can add any kind of file to an Amphora - images, text files, csv, word documents etc. To upload a file from your computer, click the blue `upload` button, select a file, then click `upload`.

> Note that you need a steady connection to upload files and some users have reported issues due to poor connection with their internet providers.

### Add a signal

[Signals](/docs/guides/models/signal.md) are numeric data that change over time. Add a signal by clicking `Signals` in the top right of your Amphora detail's page, then click the `+` button to add a new property (i.e. the name of the signal), e.g. temperature.

![Add a signal to an Amphora, Screenshot](/docs/assets/screenshots/add_signal_amphora.png)

Now you can submit a value for that signal (e.g. the current temperature) via the `New Values` button. Once submitted, you'll start seeting data on the graph.

> It may take up to a minute for the new value to be processed and to show on the graph.
