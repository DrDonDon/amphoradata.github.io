## Consume data from Amphora

You can consume data from an Amphora in three ways. You can either download a flat file, view a time series, or connect a live time-series through an API.

To consume a flat file (static file typically .txt or .csv) simply click `Download` next to the file you want under at the bottom of the Amphora page.

To view a time series, click `Signals` in the top right of the Amphora page. You should see some interesting data like this

> Note that not all Amphoras contain time series.

To connect a live time series through an API, check out the latest SDKs and sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/amphoradata).
