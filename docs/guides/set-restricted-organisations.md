> Amphora Data is currently in beta. These documents may change.

Amphora Data enables you to set restrictions on who can use and view your data. You may not want a competitor to see your data, or maybe you only want to allow one company to use your data.

To set restrictions, navigate to the Organisation page. If you want to share data or collaborate with colleagues, you can easily invite them to your organisation.

You can then add and create restrictions as you need. Only organisations on Amphora will be visible. As all users are verified and linked to an organisation, you can trust that your data will be restricted to only those you want.
