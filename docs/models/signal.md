An Amphora Data Signal is a way of representing numeric time-series data. Examples incude water levels, sensor readings, quantities, temperature etc. Signals are a great way to store data, because the storage model is standardised (meaning anyone can easily access the data), and because Signals can be transformed via aggregate methods - providing the minimum, maximum, sum, average, first, and last, of the signal over time.
