Amphora Data is a platform for storing and discovering agricultural data. Our goal is to improve on-farm outcomes by increasing the quality and quantity of data available to the ag-tech companies farmers rely on.

Our core product is an Amphora. Amphorae are containers for data. They let you package, permission, share, and value data produced by your organisation. You can also discover Amphorae produced by other organisations.
