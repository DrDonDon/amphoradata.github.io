title: The New Tech Stack

Agricultural technology is advancing rapidly. Within the last 5 years we have seen advancement in analytics, IoT and smart machinery roll out across farms, and this progress is speeding up.

Despite this progress, agriculture technology still lags other industries including banking and manufacturing. Currently, agricultural technology is very vertically integrated, with single companies owning a use case from data collection through to insights for the farmer. 

However, this is now changing. The agricultural technology stack is moving towards a traditional enterprise design. 

A changing tech stack provides lots of opportunity for agtechs to improve and optimise their products. Most importantly, farmers will tremendously benefit from simpler, cheaper, smarter and faster products including technology and analytics.

### The new tech stack has five distinct systems or layers

#### 1) System of collection

This is the hardware that collects data. It includes smart machinery, sensors and drones that provide data for use across the ecosystem. Hardware companies are increasingly competing on price as well as capability.

#### 2) System of record

This is the data storage and record keeping. This is increasingly dominated by global cloud providers including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

#### 3) System of intelligence

This is the advanced analytics and business intelligence that can turn simple data into meaningful insights for farmers.

#### 4) Integration and data sharing

These are the pipes and regulators that connect all the data between the different systems. It needs to deliver the right data to the right application in the right format at the right time.

#### 5) System of interaction

This is the user friendly software that provides specific actions to a farmer. The farmer only interacts with this layer but the software pulls data and insights from further down the technology stack.

### There are four market trends causing this shift

Increasing capability and specialisation of apps means that no one company can do it all

Developing, producing, selling and operating software and hardware is difficult. There is an arms race between hardware and software providers as evidenced by the proliferation of thousands of agtechs globally. In this environment, companies are not able to compete on multiple fronts and have to focus on making the best product for their area, not dominating the ecosystem.
Increasing quantities of varied data requires standardised integration and data sharing

Analytics and reporting software increasingly needs more and more data from different sources and  formats to be competitive. This necessitates software companies to access more data, which is extremely difficult without cooperation from third party data providers. In turn this requires commercial, technological, and legal agreements for integration and data sharing, which is cumbersome without common standards and platforms.
There is no globally dominant player to own the full stack

In the past we have seen major companies, notably IBM in the 80s and SAP in the 00s, own most— if not all— of a technology stack. Even then, IBM and SAP couldn’t hold onto their positions; they faced the rise of an ecosystem of competitors, including Microsoft and Compaq for IBM, and Salesforce and cloud ERPs for SAP. There is little likelihood of a similar globally dominant player in the agricultural technology space. 
Farmers want a seamless experience, not tinker with data

What farmers want from technology is something that is easy to use and tells them what to do. That’s it. They don’t want to talk about data, they want to talk about actions for their farm. Software for farmers needs to be seamless and easy to use. The data and insights used by the software doesn’t have to be done within it, but can come from other sources.
